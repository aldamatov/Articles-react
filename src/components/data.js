        React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views

        and render just the right components when your data changes.

        Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas
        traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in
        the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens
        when you build your app.
